## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

During this project, I learned using grids to lay divs over each other.  Also, continued practice with CSS. Specifically, workflow for adjusting to mobile displays.  

### Continued development

It's necessary for me to become more familiar with the concepts and syntax of CSS.
