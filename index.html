            <p>I welcome the unknown with the confidence that the solution is out there or can be created and what I don't know can be learned.</p>
            </p>
            <p>I was given a computer running MS-DOS at 10 years old.  Without a manual or any knowledge of how to use a computer, I tinkered my way into running a game of BattleChess. This small achievement came to define a large part of me.  I've continued with this passion for discovery and learning with the resources available on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>I've "fixed" computers or worked in IT for over 20 years.  I've used my ability to build and manage device management systems such as SCCM, Airwatch and JAMF.  I learned the skills I needed to achieve this through videos, documents, blogs and the IT communities of various forums and boards.
            </p>
            <p>This website is to display my work in Web Development.  Coding combines the problem solving skills that I've used over the years in my career and the creativity needed to overcome challenges and build something.  It has been a career I've always wanted to pursue but never did.</p>
